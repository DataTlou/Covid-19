# Covid-19
# The datasets used in this analysis was downloaded from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series and the last recorded date was 06/09/2021
# An analysis of the impact Corona Virus has in the world mainly in South Africa. Initially the goal was to analyse the impact Covid-19 has in the world but because the datasets couldn't provide country IDs, I ended up focusing on only South Africa. I used this research to answer questions like which season has the most death rate in South Africa?, Which season has increase or decrease impact in the infection rate?, does the banning of alcohol sales in South Africa help reduce the infection rate?, is there a difference in the infection rate during different lockdowns in South Africa? and does the implementation of vaccination help reduce the infection rate
# used python to clean and visualize the data. I used modules like seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.
# The analysis showed the follwing results:
# a. Autumn has the most infection rate of 5%, the lowest recovery rate of 60% with Summer having the highest recovery rate of approximately 90% and the lowest death rate of 2.5% with Summer having the highest death rate of almost 3% compared to the other seasons
# b. When alcohol sales are not banned, the infection rate is high, 2.5%, and low, 2.3%, when banned
# c. Lockdown levels can be set to level 1 from January until the end of February and the whole April month, since the rates do increase in May and March when it's level 1, the lockdown can be set to level 4 from May until the end of June and the whole March month and finally it can be eased to level 3 from July until the end of December
# d. Alcohol Sales may be banned for the whole March month and in December to reduce the infection Rate
# e. There has been a decrease in the infection rate since the first vaccination in SA. There was a maximum of approxianately 22.25% infection rate and since the first vaccination SA has had a maximum of approximately 0.7% infection rate
# So people are adviced to vaccinate
